                Functional validation and model establishment of oleic acid promoter

                We characterized the expression of the oleic acid promoter by placing the mRFP fluorescent protein under
                the control of the FadR promoter. The engineered bacteria transformed with oleic acid promoter gene were
                cultured under two environmental conditions, aerobic and anaerobic, respectively, and under two media
                conditions with or without oleic acid. The results showed that the oleic acid inducer was effectively
                triggered to produce a fluorescent signal after induction with oleic acid. In addition, the oleic acid
                promoter performed better under anaerobic conditions, indicating that the oleic acid promoter is well
                adapted to the intestinal anaerobic environment (<b>Figure 1</b>).

                In addition, we built models to predict the number of operators matching the induction thresholds of
                different oleic acid concentrations (<b>Figure 2</b>) (due to the difficulty of gene fragment
                integration, we will not be able to complete the synthesis of oleic acid promoters with different
                operator numbers before October, so we cannot conduct wet experiments for realistic verification). By
                adjusting the number of operators, We can effectively activate gene expression by controlling the
                concentration of oleic acid, which is perfectly consistent with the process of high-oil diet mentioned
                in our daily life. When the concentration of oleic acid in the diet reaches the defined limit of
                high-oil diet, the oleic acid promoter is switched on. When the concentration of oleic acid in the diet
                is below this limit, the whole system is silenced without affecting the absorption of proper nutrients
                during the normal diet. Moreover, due to the specific constitution of different people, the concept of
                high-fat diet is not fixed, and we can also adjust the number of operators to perfectly match this
                dynamic situation.

            <div class="container">In summary, it seems that in the targeted evolution of cholesterol down-regulation, different genotypes still show differences and complexity in their ability to regulate cholesterol levels. Although the combination of the three genes in tandem gave strong performance in the direct cholesterol degradation by IsmA and the down-regulation of cholesterol by bile-salt hydrolases secreted by the BSH genes, this does not mean that they can perform equally well in the regulation through short-chain fatty acids (SFAs). The optimal evolutionary pathway still needs to be evaluated and determined, and perhaps a more precise answer can be obtained in subsequent in vivo experiments.</div>
