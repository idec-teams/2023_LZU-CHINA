            <div class="container">Our team always puts experimental safety and risk control first in our projects and
                actions. After all, safety is the most important thing. We consider safety throughout the project,
                including experimental design, experimental implementation, and future impact. We strictly follow the
                national and relevant institutional safety regulations to ensure the safety of our experiments, and we
                have experienced instructors to help us control risks. </div>

            <div class="container">We use low-risk experimental materials as much as possible in the experiment.
                The organisms we use are DH5α and EcN, which are both E. coli, and they are both low-risk organisms for
                humans and the environment.
                For chemical drugs, we use harmless drugs as much as possible. When we have to use drugs with higher
                risks, we will do our best to control the risks, follow the operating specifications strictly, and use
                the drugs in specific experimental areas. Of course, all our use and storage of organisms and drugs
                strictly comply with relevant regulations and minimize risks as much as possible.

            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    First of all, in terms of experimental conditions, our laboratory has sufficient, qualified, and
                    safe facilities that can support and guarantee our experiments. In terms of experimental areas, we
                    have a standard microbiological laboratory of level 1 for low-side microbial (E. coli), which has an
                    ultra-clean table, some basic protective equipment such as disposable masks, gloves, etc. Second, we
                    also possess a moderate containment lab for experiments with higher aseptic and safety requirements,
                    which has a professional ESCO biosafety cabinet. In terms of personal protection, our laboratory
                    provides enough disposable medical gloves and masks for everyone to prevent inhalation of microbes
                    and direct contact with hazardous substances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, we have sufficient risk control measures. We have emergency shower devices and eye wash
                    devices, as well as emergency medical kits to provide emergency treatment for experimental personnel
                    when hazardous substances contact them or other injuries occur. On the walls of the laboratory, we
                    post many reminders that emphasize laboratory safety and norms to remind experimental personnel. And
                    we also post laboratory safety guidelines and laboratory safety center emergency contact numbers on
                    the outer walls of the laboratory to remind everyone who enters the laboratory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For access to the entire laboratory building, people who want to enter the building must use their
                    activated campus cards, otherwise the door cannot be opened. Only those who have submitted and
                    approved applications to the laboratory safety center can activate their campus cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For access to our laboratory, our laboratory door has fingerprint and code locks. Only our team
                    members can enter our laboratory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, before we start the experiment, each of us was trained in laboratory skills, including
                    but not limited to how to inoculate bacteria, how to use sterilization devices and how to do
                    personal protection. So during our project, it greatly reduces risks of microbes’ harm to human
                    body. In the last day of our training, our supervisor will examine us, and those who fail will
                    continue to study until they pass before being allowed to enter the lab.

            <div>Opinion acquisition</div>
            <div class="container">We will conduct interviews with experts and professors, introduce our project to
                them, and ask for their opinions in many aspects, including safety. We will pay attention to or improve
                certain safety issues based on the experts' opinions.
                And we will also introduce our project to the general public and ask for their opinions and concerns
                about the project. We will pay close attention to the safety related issues that the public is concerned
                about in order to improve the project and make the overall safety of the project better.
